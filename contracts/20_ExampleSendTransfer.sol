// Deploy the Sender contract

// Send 10 wei to the ReceiverNoAction wiht withdrawTransfer. It works, 
// because the function receive in ReceiverNoAction doesn't do anything and doesn't use up more than 2300 gas
// Send 10 wei to the ReceiverNoAction with withdrawSend. It also works, 
// because the function still does not need more than 2300 gas.
// Deploy the ReceiverAction Smart contract and copy the contract address
// Send 10 Wei to the ReceiverAction with withdrawTransfer. It fails, 
// because the contract tries to write a storage variable which costs too much gas.
// Send 10 Wei to the ReceiverAction with withdrawSend. The transaction 
// doesn't fail, but it also doesn't work, which leaves you now in an odd state. üëàüèª That's the Problem right here.
// so we use require and check for the bool value, and return a message when it is false.
